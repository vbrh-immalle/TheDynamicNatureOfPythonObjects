Example of the dynamic nature of objects in Python.

Compare this with compiled languages like C++, Java or C# where using attributes before they are defined, would result in **compilation errors**.

Javascript (another *interpreted* language, just like Python) also supports **adding attributes to objects dynamically**. For an example, clone this repo (https://github.com/enablecomputer/SnakeDirection), open `snake.html`, read the `avatar.js`-source, open the Javascript-console in the browser and experiment with the available commands.

(Note that C# has the `dynamic` keyword since 4.0: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/types/using-type-dynamic)
